Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.

I have now moved on to having it up i nthe cloud too so I can learn how to work 
with remote archives.

OK, I first did all the steps individually, now this will be for a pull.
